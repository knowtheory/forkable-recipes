1. Pour broth into a heavy medium saucepan, along with sugar, soy sauce and mirin. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low.
2. Stir egg whites and whole egg in a small bowl until just mixed.  Add chicken to the simmering broth.  Gently pour in the egg mixture, without stirring.  Sprinkle scallions on top.  When the egg starts to firm up, after about 3 minutes, stir it with chopsticks.
